filter demo - compiling

first, I compiled the stk libraries by going to the src directory and typing make

then, I copied ~/GitHub/atradom/stk/src/libstk.a to /usr/lib/
and the contents of ~/GitHub/atradom/stk/include to /usr/include/stk


then you can compile with
g++ -Wall -D__LITTLE_ENDIAN__ -I/usr/include/stk -o filter-demo filter-demo.cpp -lstk
